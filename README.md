# Data-Anlysis-Protfolio
## About

My name is Mohammed Eltahir, and I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 

I have hands-on experience in data analysis, gained through my internship with the Business Intelligence Department at Sudatel. 

In my free time, I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in data analysis, constantly seeking to learn new techniques, tools, 

and trends in the industry. I enjoy working on personal projects that challenge my analytical skills and allow me to apply my learning in practical scenarios. 

My goal is to continually grow as a data analyst and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes that drive innovation and success.
