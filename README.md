# Data-Anlysis-Protfolio
## About

My name is Mohammed Eltahir, and I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 

I have hands-on experience in data analysis, gained through my internship with the Business Intelligence Department at Sudatel. 

In my free time, I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in data analysis, constantly seeking to learn new techniques, tools, 

and trends in the industry. I enjoy working on personal projects that challenge my analytical skills and allow me to apply my learning in practical scenarios. 

My goal is to continually grow as a data analyst and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes that drive innovation and success.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
- [Tiktok Analysis](https://github.com/MOHAMMEDOSAMAXO/Protfolio-projects/blob/main/Tiktok_eda.ipynb)
  The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Tiktok dataset. EDA is a critical step in the data science process, aimed at understanding the underlying structure, patterns, and relationships within the data. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights, detect anomalies, and identify potential trends that can guide further modeling or decision-making processes.
  Understand Data Characteristics: Analyze the dataset to understand its basic properties, such as the number of records, types of variables (categorical, numerical, etc.), and missing values.

  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Identify and address any data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is ready for more detailed analysis.

  Univariate Analysis: Examine each variable independently to understand its distribution, central tendency, and variability. This includes plotting histograms, boxplots, and calculating summary statistics.

  Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables, using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and cross-tabulations. This helps in identifying patterns or correlations that might be important for further analysis.

  Data Visualization: Develop clear and informative visualizations that effectively communicate the key findings from the analysis. This includes the use of various plotting techniques to represent the data in an easy-to-understand manner.

  This project is just a continuation of the previous project [Tiktok Analysis](https://github.com/MOHAMMEDOSAMAXO/Protfolio-projects/blob/main/Tiktok_eda.ipynb), howvere I tried different models to detect the claim staus for tiktok vidoes, I have cleaned the data following some data cleaning method to prepare my data for the machine learning, I have selected two different modesl Random Forest and XGBoost, the model preformed really good since the metrics presented a high results.

  

- [F1 2021 Season analysis](https://github.com/MOHAMMEDOSAMAXO/Protfolio-projects/blob/main/F1_Data_analysis.ipynb)
  This project aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the F1 2021 season dataset. Formula 1, being one of the most data-rich sports, provides an opportunity to dive deep into the intricacies of the races, drivers, teams, and circuits. Through this analysis, we will explore the key factors that influenced the outcomes of the 2021 season, uncover performance trends, and identify the elements that contributed to the success or challenges faced by teams and drivers.
